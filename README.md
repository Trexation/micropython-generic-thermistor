# Micropython Generic Thermistor Library

Micropython Generic Thermistor Library is a basic software module designed to simplify temperature sensing using thermistors within MicroPython-based projects. The library assumes a generic thermistor on the ground side of a voltage divider. It provides functions for converting raw analog sensor readings into temperature values, taking into account the non-linear nature of thermistors using the Î² parameter equation.
